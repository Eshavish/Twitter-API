The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.
You can use data-ng-, instead of ng-, if you want to make your page HTML valid.
p>My first expression: {{ 5 + 5 }}</p>
My first expression: 10
AngularJS expressions bind AngularJS data to HTML the same way as the ng-bind directive.
